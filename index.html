        <p> My hobbie is reading.Reading is my fravroite thing to do after school. I also like to read before I go to bed. And after I wake up. I am reading a book called the mystrious benadict sussiuty. It is about 4 really smart kids trying to save the world. I also like harry poter and woriers. When I read I read for a long time.When I read I get really consentrated. I read at school. I read at home. And I also read at the park. I am very picky about what I read. some times I just wont read some books. But when i find a book I like a read it alot. I read it whenever i can. I love reading. Some times my parents cant get me to stop. When i go to the book store i always get the next two books to my seires not only one.</p>
